    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>
    I am a teaching assistant for <strong>198:170 - Computer Applications
      for Business</strong> for Fall 2013. If you'd like a special permission
      number, you'll have to contact your professor or apply online at the
      <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu">Rutgers Computer Science page</a>.
      Currently I've got the following sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Section 4</strong> <br />
          Tuesday, 3:05-4:00, College Avenue Satellite Lab
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Section 9</strong> <br />
          Tuesday, 10:35-11:30, ARC 118
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Previously, I've also been a peer leader for 198:111 - Intro to Computer
      Science. Feel free to ask me general computer science questions, or come
      hang out with the rest of the Computer Science crew at the CAVE on the
      second floor of the Hill Center.
    </p>

    <h3>Contacting Me</h3>
    <p>
      My office hours are at <a href="http://rumaps.rutgers.edu/location/hill-center-bldg-for-the-mathematical-sciences">HILL 378</a>,
      on Fridays from 1:30-2:30. You can also catch me at my lab
      support hours in Records Hall on College Avenue on Thursdays
      from 2PM to 4PM. If you need additional assistance for CS 170, you can
      also look on Sakai for the full Lab Support schedule and visit any TA,
      not just me. For any and all academic questions, contact me at
      <a href="mailto:kds124@rutgers.edu">kds124@rutgers.edu</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more general help with computer science, you can send me
      an email or visit <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/resources/rooms_and_equipment/cave/">
        the CAVE</a> at the Hill Center, a Linux computer lounge open to all students,
      especially those interested in computer science.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting Code</h3>
    <p>
      Important code and other examples done in class will be posted on Sakai.
      It's also all version-controlled in a
      <a href="https://github.com/ksuarz/comp-apps">Git repository</a>. If
      you'd like to keep up-to-date with all the latest stuff, you can clone my
      repository:
      <script src="http://gist.github.com/ksuarz/6409539.js"></script>
      <!-- TODO : alternative if the gist doesn't link (i.e. mobile) -->
      If you use Mac or Windows, let me know and I can give you more specific
      instructions for your operating system. You can also use <a
      href="resources/clonecode.sh">this script</a> if you have a UNIX-like machine and
      are lazy or unfamiliar with Git. (No malicious code, don't worry.)
    </p>

    <h3>Resources and Examples</h3>
    <p>
      Here are some useful examples using HTML. If you're lost when starting an
      HTML assignment, these might give you some inspiration.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="resources/boilerplate.html">HTML Boilerplate</a></li>
        <li>The <a href=https://www.github.com/ksuarz/website/index.html">
             HTML source</a> for this website</li>
